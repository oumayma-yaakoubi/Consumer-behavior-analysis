# Consumer-behavior-analysis
In this project we will vestigate the impact of various factors, such as seasonality, item attributes (size and color), and promotional activities (discounts and promo codes), on customer purchase decisions. 

Using the Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset we will analyze the relationship between customer demographics (age and gender) and their purchase behavior.
